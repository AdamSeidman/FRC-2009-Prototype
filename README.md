# FRC-2009-Prototype
As the head programmer of FRC team 25, [Raider Robotix](http://www.raiderrobotix.org/), I am using this repository to demonstrate how to code robots to incoming freshmen who want to learn how. 
I am doing so on an old [2009 robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldJLMVWIqCw&feature=youtu.be) prototype made of plexiglass.
